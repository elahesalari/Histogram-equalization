# Histogram Equalization

Histogram equalization is a widely used image processing technique for contrast adjustment based on the imageâ€™s intensity histogram. This method enhances the global contrast of images, particularly when the useful image data is confined to a narrow range of intensity values.  

By redistributing the intensity values across the entire available range, histogram equalization improves the visibility of features in areas with low local contrast. It effectively spreads out the most frequent intensity values, resulting in a more balanced and enhanced contrast throughout the image.
