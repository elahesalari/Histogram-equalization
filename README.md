# Histogram-equalization
Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using 
the imageâ€™s histogram. This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when 
the usable data of the image is represented by close contrast values. Through this adjustment, the intensities 
can be better distributed on the histogram. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher 
contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity 
values
